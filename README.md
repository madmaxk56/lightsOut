# lightsOut
Python and Java version of the game Lights Out

Lights Out is playable as a runnable Jar file. A Python version will be added later

The goal of Light's Out is to turn all yellow squares black (turning off the light) in the grid. Clicking on a square will switch the light, but will also switch the lights for 
the square's 4 neighbors. There are 10 levels in total. Can you achieve a perfect score?
